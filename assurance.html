                                One of the first things we look at before we Qualify any seller’s product is: what is it
                                made of? We begin our search by looking for products made from the most sustainable, or
                                “best-in-class” materials or ingredients in each particular product category
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s important to us that the materials and ingredients that our impaneled brands use
                                preserve the planet for future generations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By making this the first step of our 5 stage methodology, we can promise you that the
                                products you buy on CornerDukaan are made from better ‘stuff.’ Because we know that when
                                you buy good stuff, more of the good stuff–and less of the bad–get made. It’s simple
                                economics!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And, just to make sure you’re getting the most out of your CornerDukaan experience, we
                                provide resources so that you can see for yourself why the materials are absolutely
                                awesome

                                Looking at materials is just the first step. In addition to the foundation of each
                                product, we want to look at the foundation of each company. What are their company
                                values? How do they show responsibility in the production of their products, the
                                treatment of their workers, and corners that they refuse to cut?
                            </p>

                                While we love supporting locally made brands, we also support companies that make
                                their products responsibly abroad.

                                We believe that location of production does not, on its own, determine the
                                sustainability of the product, and try to weigh all of the benefits of each product and
                                company together when making decisions about what to sell on CornerDukaan.

                                CornerDukaan celebrates brands that make giving resources, time, and service to various

                                possible.
