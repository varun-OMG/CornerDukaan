                                Organic means something that is created without the use of any chemical ingredients,
                                artificial elements, or pesticides.
                                It simply stands for products that are made with healthy ingredients; eliminating the
                                existence of chemicals, pesticides, or hazardous components in them.
                                IMany research studies have suggestedthat organic food has more nutritional
                                value than traditionally grown food products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Organic is often synonymous with natural because, in this method, the producers try to
                                reduce the concentration of hazardous elements in the production process. Therefore, the
                                crops and other agricultural produce then grown is free of the perilous substances or
                                ingredients. This practice makes the food healthier and removes any detrimental toxins
                                from the food.
